					<h1> Information </h1>

						Our goal at Kitten Mittons isn't to sell you mittons for your kitten. Weird, right? WELL.. we've already done that! Do you remember these words.... 
					</p>

					<h4> Hello, Charlie Kelly here, local business owner and cat enthusiast. Is your cat making too much noise all the time? Is your cat constantly stomping around driving you crazy? Is your cat clawing at your furniture? Think there's no answer? You're so stupid! There is! Kitten Mittons. Finally, there is an elegant, comfortable mitton for cats! Is your cat one-legged? Is your cat fat, skinny, or an in-between? That doesn't matter! Cause one size fits all! Kitten Mittons! You'll be smitten! </h4>
					
					<p>
						After making over a billion dollars selling mittons to pet-parents who had noisy kittens, our President, Charlie Day, looked within his heart and thought.. "but what about those kittens who can't afford our mittons?". After this sad thought, Charlie realized that he needed to use his very successful life to help others. AND YOU CAN TOO!! 
					</p>
		
					<p>
						Donate right now! Just $17 provides 1 cat with a set of kitten mittons! That's all! Why not donate $85 and help 5 kittens? Do you buy coffee everyday? Do you aimlessly online shop in order to replace the feelings of abandonment you have from your childhood? Use that money for good instead!! Donate money to us and we'll make sure that kittens get their mittons!
